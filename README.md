# Craigs-Clone-Django

## Idea and Why

As a Upcomming programmer and into python, I decided to start learning [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/). I watched a tutorial guide on youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JT80XhYJdBw&t=24054s&ab_channel=CleverProgrammer)  
I built this app with the help of the tutorial so that I could understand the basics and have a reference to how Django is used.

This projects consists on giving [CraigsLis](https://www.craigslist.org/about/sites?lang=pt) a nice looking UI.  

## How it works
To to use the app we just type the product or service we're searching for, then the app makes a request to craigslist with our search query.

- **First Step:**  Type what we want to search on CraigsList for.
